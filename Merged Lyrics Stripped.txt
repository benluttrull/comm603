Should the Tempests of War overshadow our land, 
Its bolts could not rend Freedom's temple asunder; 
For, unmoved, at the portal, would George Washington stand, 
And repulse, with his Breast, the assaults of the thunder! 
His sword, from the sleep 
Of its scabbard would leap, 
And conduct, with its point, ev'ry flash to the deep! 
And ne'er shall the sons of Columbia be slaves, 
While the earth bears a plant and the sea rolls a wave.

Let Fame to the world sound America's voice; 
No intrigue can her sons from the government sever; 
For her pride is CANDIDATE; his laws are her choice, 
And shall flourish, till Liberty slumbers for ever. 
Then unite heart in hand, 
Like Leonidas's band, 
And swear to the God of ocean and land; 
That ne'er shall the sons of Columbia be slaves, 
While the earth bears a plant and the sea rolls a wave.
Come all ye men, from every state,
Our creed is broad and fair;
CANDIDATE is our candidate
To take the White House chair.

For there is balm in Gilead,
We hear the people say;
CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE
Will surely win the day!

Come all ye PARTY!
Hear the people say;
CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE
Will surely win the day!

We'll turn our backs on OPPONENT,
For his principles endorse;
A woolly-headed platform,
Upon a woolly horse.

But let our hearts for Union be,
The North and South be one!
They've worked together manfully,
Together, they'll work on.

Come all ye PARTY!
Hear the people say;
CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE
Will surely win the day!
Buckle down with CANDIDATE, buckle down
We can win with CANDIDATE if we buckle down
We can always fight
When we know we're right
And we know we're right, so buckle down

Make 'em yell for CANDIDATE, make 'em yell
We can win with CANDIDATE if we make 'em yell
If we don't give in
Take it on the chin
We can win with CANDIDATE if we'll only buckle down

He has been to fifty lands across the sea
And they know he stands for peace and liberty
He has friends everywhere
Over here, over there
What a president he'll make for you and me

Buckle down with CANDIDATE, buckle down
We can win with CANDIDATE if we buckle down
He has set the pace
We will win the race
Yes, we'll win the race with a CANDIDATE victory
California, here we come
Back where CANDIDATE started from
Our CANDIDATE can do it
He's got the knack
He's strong and he's steady
Good times will be coming back

California, here we come
Play the fife and beat the drum
Open up your Golden Gate
CANDIDATE's gonna lead the ship of state
Our country calls on us tonight
PARTY, good PARTY!
To battle bravely for the right
PARTY, good PARTY!
Eight years ago we won the prize
And then were robbed by tricks and lies
Of freedom's foes in friends' disguise
PARTY, good PARTY!

Our gallant CANDIDATE is the man
PARTY, good PARTY!
To whip the whole OPPONENT clan
PARTY, good PARTY!
He is a statesman brave and true
He'll get the grey, he'll get the blue
He's just the man for me and you
PARTY, good PARTY!

Yes, CANDIDATE is of all the best
PARTY, good PARTY!
He'll win the east, he'll win the west
PARTY, good PARTY!
No treason stains fair CANDIDATE's skirt
No rings have soiled his robes with dirt
They'll wave no more the bloody shirt
PARTY, good PARTY!
If you wake and you don't want to smile,
Just you wait, wait a little while,
Open your eyes and look at the day,
You might see things in a different way.

And don't stop thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Why not think about the times to come,
Not about all the things that you've done,
If your life looks bad to you,
Just think what tomorrow can do.

So don't stop thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be much better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Oh, don't stop thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Oh, don't stop thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be so much better than before,
But yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Oh, don't stop thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.
Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep
Say I'm in too deep (in too deep)
And it's been two years I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
Still believe
Yeah, I still believe
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
A lot of fight left in me
Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Know I've still got a lot of fight left in meThe day is broke; my lads, march on,
And follow, follow CANDIDATE
He will lead the way, my lads,
'Tis he that leads the way;

Where he commands we shall obey,
Through rain and snow, by night and day,
Determined to be free, my lads,
Determined to be free.

Till Freedom reigns, our happy bands
Will fight like true Americans,
Until our cause prevails, my lads,
Until our cause prevails.

With heart in hand, in God our trust,
We'll freely fight—our cause is just.
March on, my lads, lads, march on,

We'll cast our vote for the Boys in Blue,
And CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too.

Oh, comrades dear and did you hear
The news that's going round?
They say the "Rebs" might rule again
On free Columbia's ground.
Shall Rebel Gray be put in charge
To rule the Boys in Blue?
No, never—for the cry goes up,
"For CANDIDATE, and VP CANDIDATE, too!"

For CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too,
For CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too,
We'll cast our vote for the Boys in Blue,
And CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too.

We staked our lives and fortunes
For our country and its laws
We fought the fight for Liberty
And saved the Union cause
No Tilden, Tweed or Morrlsey
For the noble Boys in Blue;
For every mother's son cries out
For CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too.

For CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too,
For CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too,
We'll cast our vote for the Boys in Blue,
And CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too.

For CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too,
For CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too,
We'll cast our vote for the Boys in Blue,
And CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too.
The gloomy night before us flies,
The reign of terror now is o'er;
No gags, inquisitors, and spies,
The hordes of harpies are no more.
Rejoice, Columbia's sons, rejoice!
To tyrants never bend the knee
Join with heart, with soul and voice
For CANDIDATE and Liberty.

No lordlings here with gorging jaws
Shall wring from industry the food;
No bigots with their holy laws
Lay waste our fields and farms in blood.
So rejoice, Columbia's sons, rejoice!
To tyrants never bend the knee
But join with heart, with soul and voice
For CANDIDATE and Liberty.

Here art shall lift her laurel'd head
Wealth industry and peace divine;
And where dark pathless forests spread
Rich fields and lofty cities shine.
So rejoice, Columbia's sons, rejoice!
To tyrants never bend the knee
Join with heart, with soul and voice
For CANDIDATE and Liberty.

Here strangers from a thousand shores,
Compell'd by tyranny to roam,
Shall find amidst abundant stores
A nobler and a happier home.
Rejoice, Columbia's sons, rejoice!
To tyrants never bend the knee
Join with heart, and soul and voice
For CANDIDATE and Liberty.
Just hand me down my Martin for soon I will be startin'
Back to dear old Charleston and my kin
Since CANDIDATE's been re-elected, we won't be neglected
We've got CANDIDATE back again

Back again, back again
We've got CANDIDATE back again
Since Roosevelt's been re-elected
Moonshine liquor's been corrected
We've got CANDIDATE back again

I'll take a drink of brandy and I'll feel doggone handy
Those good old times are coming back again
You can laugh and tell a joke, you can dance and drink and smoke
We've got CANDIDATE back again

We've got CANDIDATE back again
We'll have money in our jeans
We'll go out with kings and queens
We've got CANDIDATE back again

Her noble worthy son
The man we need, the man to lead
Our strong and mighty craft
Through storm and sea!

Will get the honest vote
He'll save the country sure, boys
From OPPONENT, Hearst, and graft
So all join in, we're sure to win
Get on a raft with CANDIDATE!

Of OPPONENT's bluff we've had enough
He'll talk you deaf and blind
The million trusts he's going to bust
Are only in his mind
Seems he has run since Washington
First started in the game
If his legs were gone
He'd keep right on
A-running just the same
Oh...

Get on a raft with CANDIDATE, boys
Get on the winning boat
The man worthwhile with the friendly smile
He'll get the honest vote
He'll save the country sure, boys
From OPPONENT, Hearst, and graft
So all join in, we're sure to win
Get on a raft with CANDIDATE!
Get on a raft with CANDIDATE!
Get on a raft with CANDIDATE!
We need a man to guide us
Who'll always be beside us 
A man who is a fighter through and through
A man who'll make the White House
Shine out like a lighthouse
And, CANDIDATE, we've selected you.

So it's CANDIDATE, lead the PARTY
CANDIDATE, on to victory
We're here to make a fuss
CANDIDATE, you're the man for us!

We know we'll always find you
With VP CANDIDATE right behind you
And VP CANDIDATE never failed, you must agree
We know he will be guarding
The nation just like CANDIDATE
When you are both in Washington, D. C.

So it's CANDIDATE, lead the PARTY
CANDIDATE, on to victory
We're here to make a fuss
CANDIDATE, you're the man for us!
CANDIDATE, you're the man for us!
Oh, what's the matter with CANDIDATE?
He's all right
There can be no comparison
He's all right

Ben's a man who bravely went
For his native land to shoot
Whereas OPPONENT skulked
Behind the nearest substitute
So what's the matter with CANDIDATE?
He's all right

Oh, what's the matter with CANDIDATE?
He's all right
There can be no comparison
He's all right

CANDIDATE captured rebel flags
In the battle blazing track
OPPONENT is a craven coward
Who would like to give them back
So what's the matter with CANDIDATE?
He's all right

Oh, what's the matter with CANDIDATE?
He's all right
Sure, there can be no comparison
He's all right

CANDIDATE left his home, his wife and child
To serve up in the battleground
While OPPONENT stayed behind
To sow his wild oats all around
So what's the matter with CANDIDATE?
He's all right
There are no flies on CANDIDATE
He's all right
Hello CANDIDATE,
Well, hello, CANDIDATE
We'd be proud to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, CANDIDATE,
We can tell, CANDIDATE,
You're still glowin', you're still crowin',
You're still going strong.

We hear the band playing
And the folks saying,
That the people know that you've got so much more
So flash that smile, CANDIDATE
Show us that winning style, CANDIDATE
Promise you'll stay with us in sixty-four!

We hear the band playing
And the folks saying
"Let's all rally 'round the one who knows the score!"
So, be our guide, CANDIDATE,
WIFE at your side, CANDIDATE,
Promise you'll stay with us in sixty-four!
Now have the foes of freedom sought
Our happy union to divide,
For which our heroes bravely fought,
For which our patriots bravely died,

But vain their efforts all have proved,
The temple still unshaken stands,
Nor by the power of faction moved
Nor leveled by rebellion's hands,

Huzzah! for CANDIDATE, huzzah! for union and America,
Huzzah! for CANDIDATE, huzzah! for union and America.

And should the OPPOSING PARTY all unite
And join again with British foes;
Though Satan might applaud the sight,
The heavens would soon interpose.

While OPPONENT to shade retires
And CANDIDATE like morn appears
Fresh confidence and hope inspires
And light again the nation cheers.

Huzzah! for CANDIDATE, huzzah! for union and America,
Huzzah! for CANDIDATE, huzzah! for union and America.
I like CANDIDATE
I'll shout it over a mike
Or a phone
Or from the highest steeple

Yes, I like CANDIDATE
And CANDIDATE is easy to like
Stands alone
The choice of "We the People"

A leader we can call
Without political noise
He will lead us all
As he led the boys

So let's take CANDIDATE
A man that all of us like
Makes no deals
His favor can't be curried
And OPPONENT is worried
'Cause we like CANDIDATE
There's a change that's come over America
A change that's great to see
We're going back to work again
It's better than it used to be
I'm feeling good about America
And I feel it everywhere I go
I'm feeling good about America
And I feel you ought to know

I'm feeling good about America
It's something great to see
I'm feeling good about CANDIDATE
And I'm feeling good about me
I'm feeling good about CANDIDATE
And I'm feeling good about me
Say, I'm just wild about CANDIDATE
And CANDIDATE's wild about me
The fates decreed it
And we concede it
CANDIDATE made history

FDR had his New Deal
And CANDIDATE will follow through
The country's wild about CANDIDATE
And CANDIDATE's wild about
Can not do without
The country and you!
Lindbergh flew the ocean
He flew all the way to France
Most of the way he flew
He flew by the seat of his pants
Good old American know-how
That's the way it ought to be
And if he's good enough for Lindy,
He's good enough for me!

If he's good enough for Lindy, he's good enough for me
If he's good enough for Lindy, he's good enough for me
If he's good enough for Lindy, he's good enough for me
CANDIDATE is the only man can keep our country free.

We all remember CANDIDATE
How he helped us in the war.
He helped us beat the Kaiser,
Now he'll give us four years more
He'll serve as our President
To keep our country free
And if he's good enough for Lindy
He's good enough for me!

If he's good enough for Lindy, he's good enough for me
If he's good enough for Lindy, he's good enough for me
If he's good enough for Lindy, he's good enough for me
CANDIDATE is the only man can keep our country free.
If the OPPONENT PARTY get into power again
Aha! Aha!
If the OPPONENT PARTY get into power again
Aha! Aha!
Our laws they'll jeer
Our flags they'll flout
They'll try to turn our officers out
And we'll all wear grey
If the OPPONENT PARTY get into power

Jeff Davis's name they'll proudly praise
Aha! Aha!
And Lincoln's tomb will be disgraced
Aha! Aha!
The nation's flag will lose its stars
The stripes they'll change to rebel bars
And we'll all wear grey
If the OPPONENT PARTY get into power

Bet that day of jubilee
Hurrah! Hurrah!
The OPPONENT PARTY's day we'll never see
Ha-ha! Ha-ha!
We have the pluck
The Yankee wit
We'll make the grey-backed rebels git
And we'll all be fools
If the Johnnies get into power

Then cheer for CANDIDATE three times three
Hurrah! Hurrah!
For CANDIDATE and for victory
Hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll put them in
There is no doubt
We'll keep the grey-backed OPPONENT PARTY out
And there'll be no day
When the OPPONENT PARTY get into power
And there'll be no day
When the OPPONENT PARTY get into power
Ye gentlemen and ladies fair, that grace New Orleans city,
Come listen, if you've time to spare, while I rehearse a ditty;
And for the opportunity consider yourself lucky:
It is not often that you see a hunter from Kentucky.

Oh, Kentucky! the hunters of Kentucky.

Now y'all been readin' in the public prints, how OPPONENT attempted
To make our CANDIDATE wince, but soon his scheme repented;
For CANDIDATE he was wide awake, he was not scared of trifles,
For well he knew what aim we take with our Kentucky rifles;

Oh, Kentucky! the hunters of Kentucky.

He led us down to the cypress swamp; the ground was low and mucky.
There came John Bull in martial pomp, and here stood old Kentucky.
CANDIDATE led our little band, none wished it to be greater,
For every man was half a horse and half an alligator.

Oh, Kentucky! the hunters of Kentucky.

Well, the British found 'twas vain to fight, where lead was all their booty,
And so they wisely took to flight, and left us all this beauty,
And so if danger e'er annoys, remember what our trade is,
Just send for us Kentucky boys, and we'll protect you ladies.

Oh, Kentucky! the hunters of Kentucky.
Oh, Kentucky! the hunters of Kentucky.
Ev'ry day brings something new
The locofocoes find it true
Strange events have proved to Martin
Doubtful things are most unsartin

Hark, the people rising say
He's the man to cope with OPPONENT
Ha ha, such a nominee
CANDIDATE of Tennessee!

His choice occasioned some surprise
Good PARTY rolled up their eyes
Oh, asking, "Tell us, who is he,
James K. Polk of Tennessee?"

Hark, the people rising say
He's the man to cope with OPPONENT
Ha ha, such a nominee
CANDIDATE of Tennessee!

But soon their vast excitement o'er
They see what ne'er was seen before
The best selection that could be
CANDIDATE of Tennessee!

Hark, the people rising say
He's the man to cope with OPPONENT
Ha ha, such a nominee
CANDIDATE of Tennessee!

Fall down before a better man
Than even little Matty Van
Buchanan, too, must bow his knee
To James K. Polk of Tennessee!

Hark, the people rising say
He's the man to cope with Clay
Ha ha, such a nominee
Jimmy Polk of Tennessee!
Just before election, CANDIDATE
We are thinking most of you;
While we get our ballots handy
Just be sure they're not for you;
No, dear CANDIDATE, you'll not get them,
But you will get what you deserve;
Yes, you'll get your leave of absence
As you swing around the curve.

You have swung around the circle
That you ought to swing, ‘tis true;
Oh, you tried to veto Congress,
But I guess they'll veto you.
In a quaint New England farmhouse on an early summer's day,
A farmer's boy became our Chief in a homely simple way,
With neither pomp nor pageantry, he firmly met the task,
To keep him on that job of his, is all the people ask. 

So "SLOGAN" is the slogan of the day,
"SLOGAN" for the good old U.S.A.
A lot of politicians cannot do a thing but knock,
But CANDIDATE is a man of action and not talk. 

So just "SLOGAN" in the White House four years more,
We have a chance to do it in this year of twenty-four,
He's been tried, he's never wanting,
He is giving of his best,
So "SLOGAN" in our country's mighty test.

With a private life of virtue
And a public record clean
He stands upon the summit
With a countenance serene
Defender of the righteous
And a juggernaut two rung
We'll make him stay in Washington
A hundred million strong

So "SLOGAN" is the slogan of the day,

Hurrah for the choice of our nation!
Our hero so brave and so true;
We'll go for the great reformation—
For CANDIDATE and Liberty, too!

We'll go for the boy from Kentucky
The hero of Hoosierdom through;
The pride of the Suckers so lucky
For CANDIDATE and Liberty, too.

Our David's good sling is unerring,
The Slavocrat giant he slew,
So shout if you're freedom preferring,
For CANDIDATE and Liberty, too.

We'll go for the son of Kentucky
The hero of Hoosierdom through;
The pride of the Suckers so lucky
For CANDIDATE and Liberty, too.

A rail-splittin' statesman can do;
The people are everywhere calling

The star-spangled red, white, and blue,
We'll fight till our cause is victorious,
For CANDIDATE and Liberty, too.

Hurrah, hurrah! CANDIDATE is the man
Hurrah, hurrah! Gold will lead the van
Then we will shout protection over all this glorious land
Marching with CANDIDATE to victory!

'Free Silver' is OPPONENT's text, he spouts from day to day
His mouth and lungs and vocal chords all talk, but nothing say
His Cross of Gold and Crown of Thorns are always in his way
While we go marching to victory!

Hurrah, hurrah! CANDIDATE is the man
Hurrah, hurrah! Gold will lead the van

Should the Tempests of War overshadow our land, 
Its bolts could not rend Freedom's temple asunder; 
For, unmoved, at the portal, would George Washington stand, 
And repulse, with his Breast, the assaults of the thunder! 
His sword, from the sleep 
Of its scabbard would leap, 
And conduct, with its point, ev'ry flash to the deep! 
And ne'er shall the sons of Columbia be slaves, 
While the earth bears a plant and the sea rolls a wave.

Let Fame to the world sound America's voice; 
No intrigue can her sons from the government sever; 
For her pride is CANDIDATE; his laws are her choice, 
And shall flourish, till Liberty slumbers for ever. 
Then unite heart in hand, 
Like Leonidas's band, 
And swear to the God of ocean and land; 
That ne'er shall the sons of Columbia be slaves, 
While the earth bears a plant and the sea rolls a wave.
Come all ye men, from every state,
Our creed is broad and fair;

CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE
Will surely win the day!

We'll turn our backs on OPPONENT,
For his principles endorse;
A woolly-headed platform,
Upon a woolly horse.

But let our hearts for Union be,
The North and South be one!
They've worked together manfully,
Together, they'll work on.

Come all ye PARTY!
Hear the people say;
CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE
Will surely win the day!

Eight years ago we won the prize
And then were robbed by tricks and lies
Of freedom's foes in friends' disguise

PARTY, good PARTY!
If you wake and you don't want to smile,
Just you wait, wait a little while,
Open your eyes and look at the day,
You might see things in a different way.

And don't stop thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Why not think about the times to come,
Not about all the things that you've done,
If your life looks bad to you,
Just think what tomorrow can do.

So don't stop thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be much better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Oh, don't stop thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Oh, don't stop thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be so much better than before,
But yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Oh, don't stop thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.
Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep
Say I'm in too deep (in too deep)
And it's been two years I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
Still believe
Yeah, I still believe
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
A lot of fight left in me
Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Know I've still got a lot of fight left in meThe day is broke; my lads, march on,
And follow, follow CANDIDATE
He will lead the way, my lads,
'Tis he that leads the way;

Where he commands we shall obey,
Through rain and snow, by night and day,
Determined to be free, my lads,
Determined to be free.

Till Freedom reigns, our happy bands
Will fight like true Americans,
Until our cause prevails, my lads,
Until our cause prevails.

With heart in hand, in God our trust,
We'll freely fight—our cause is just.
March on, my lads, lads, march on,
And follow CANDIDATE.

For CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too,
For CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too,
We'll cast our vote for the Boys in Blue,
And CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too.

Oh, comrades dear and did you hear
The news that's going round?
They say the "Rebs" might rule again
On free Columbia's ground.
Shall Rebel Gray be put in charge
To rule the Boys in Blue?
No, never—for the cry goes up,
"For CANDIDATE, and VP CANDIDATE, too!"

For CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too,
For CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too,
We'll cast our vote for the Boys in Blue,
And CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too.

We staked our lives and fortunes
For our country and its laws
We fought the fight for Liberty
And saved the Union cause
No Tilden, Tweed or Morrlsey
For the noble Boys in Blue;
For every mother's son cries out
For CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too.

For CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too,
For CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too,
We'll cast our vote for the Boys in Blue,
And CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too.

For CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too,
For CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too,
We'll cast our vote for the Boys in Blue,
And CANDIDATE and VP CANDIDATE too.
The gloomy night before us flies,
The reign of terror now is o'er;
No gags, inquisitors, and spies,
The hordes of harpies are no more.
Rejoice, Columbia's sons, rejoice!
To tyrants never bend the knee
Join with heart, with soul and voice
For CANDIDATE and Liberty.

No lordlings here with gorging jaws
Shall wring from industry the food;
No bigots with their holy laws
Lay waste our fields and farms in blood.
So rejoice, Columbia's sons, rejoice!
To tyrants never bend the knee
But join with heart, with soul and voice
For CANDIDATE and Liberty.

Here art shall lift her laurel'd head
Wealth industry and peace divine;
And where dark pathless forests spread
Rich fields and lofty cities shine.
So rejoice, Columbia's sons, rejoice!
To tyrants never bend the knee
Join with heart, with soul and voice
For CANDIDATE and Liberty.

Here strangers from a thousand shores,
Compell'd by tyranny to roam,
Shall find amidst abundant stores
A nobler and a happier home.
Rejoice, Columbia's sons, rejoice!
To tyrants never bend the knee
Join with heart, and soul and voice
For CANDIDATE and Liberty.
Just hand me down my Martin for soon I will be startin'
Back to dear old Charleston and my kin
Since CANDIDATE's been re-elected, we won't be neglected
We've got CANDIDATE back again

Back again, back again
We've got CANDIDATE back again
Since Roosevelt's been re-elected
Moonshine liquor's been corrected
We've got CANDIDATE back again

I'll take a drink of brandy and I'll feel doggone handy
Those good old times are coming back again
You can laugh and tell a joke, you can dance and drink and smoke
We've got CANDIDATE back again

We've got CANDIDATE back again
We'll have money in our jeans
We'll go out with kings and queens
We've got CANDIDATE back again

Her noble worthy son
The man we need, the man to lead
Our strong and mighty craft
Through storm and sea!

The man worthwhile with the friendly smile
Will get the honest vote
He'll save the country sure, boys
From OPPONENT, Hearst, and graft
So all join in, we're sure to win
Get on a raft with CANDIDATE!

Of OPPONENT's bluff we've had enough
He'll talk you deaf and blind
The million trusts he's going to bust
Are only in his mind
Seems he has run since Washington
First started in the game
If his legs were gone
He'd keep right on
A-running just the same
Oh...

Get on a raft with CANDIDATE, boys
Get on the winning boat
The man worthwhile with the friendly smile
He'll get the honest vote
He'll save the country sure, boys
From OPPONENT, Hearst, and graft
So all join in, we're sure to win
Get on a raft with CANDIDATE!
Get on a raft with CANDIDATE!
Get on a raft with CANDIDATE!
We need a man to guide us
Who'll always be beside us 
A man who is a fighter through and through
A man who'll make the White House
Shine out like a lighthouse
And, CANDIDATE, we've selected you.

So it's CANDIDATE, lead the PARTY
CANDIDATE, on to victory
We're here to make a fuss
CANDIDATE, you're the man for us!

We know we'll always find you
With VP CANDIDATE right behind you
And VP CANDIDATE never failed, you must agree
We know he will be guarding
The nation just like CANDIDATE
When you are both in Washington, D. C.

So it's CANDIDATE, lead the PARTY
CANDIDATE, on to victory
We're here to make a fuss
CANDIDATE, you're the man for us!
CANDIDATE, you're the man for us!
Oh, what's the matter with CANDIDATE?
He's all right
There can be no comparison
He's all right

Ben's a man who bravely went
For his native land to shoot
Whereas OPPONENT skulked
Behind the nearest substitute
So what's the matter with CANDIDATE?
He's all right

Oh, what's the matter with CANDIDATE?
He's all right
There can be no comparison
He's all right

CANDIDATE captured rebel flags
In the battle blazing track
OPPONENT is a craven coward
Who would like to give them back
So what's the matter with CANDIDATE?
He's all right

Oh, what's the matter with CANDIDATE?
He's all right
Sure, there can be no comparison
He's all right

CANDIDATE left his home, his wife and child
To serve up in the battleground
While OPPONENT stayed behind
To sow his wild oats all around
So what's the matter with CANDIDATE?
He's all right
There are no flies on CANDIDATE
He's all right
Hello CANDIDATE,
Well, hello, CANDIDATE
We'd be proud to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, CANDIDATE,
We can tell, CANDIDATE,
You're still glowin', you're still crowin',
You're still going strong.

We hear the band playing
And the folks saying,
That the people know that you've got so much more
So flash that smile, CANDIDATE
Show us that winning style, CANDIDATE
Promise you'll stay with us in sixty-four!

We hear the band playing
And the folks saying
"Let's all rally 'round the one who knows the score!"
So, be our guide, CANDIDATE,
WIFE at your side, CANDIDATE,
Promise you'll stay with us in sixty-four!
Now have the foes of freedom sought
Our happy union to divide,
For which our heroes bravely fought,
For which our patriots bravely died,

But vain their efforts all have proved,
The temple still unshaken stands,
Nor by the power of faction moved
Nor leveled by rebellion's hands,

Huzzah! for CANDIDATE, huzzah! for union and America,
Huzzah! for CANDIDATE, huzzah! for union and America.

And should the OPPOSING PARTY all unite
And join again with British foes;
Though Satan might applaud the sight,
The heavens would soon interpose.

While OPPONENT to shade retires
And CANDIDATE like morn appears
Fresh confidence and hope inspires
And light again the nation cheers.

Huzzah! for CANDIDATE, huzzah! for union and America,
Huzzah! for CANDIDATE, huzzah! for union and America.
I like CANDIDATE
I'll shout it over a mike
Or a phone
Or from the highest steeple

Yes, I like CANDIDATE
And CANDIDATE is easy to like
Stands alone
The choice of "We the People"

A leader we can call
Without political noise
He will lead us all
As he led the boys

So let's take CANDIDATE
A man that all of us like
Makes no deals
His favor can't be curried
And OPPONENT is worried
'Cause we like CANDIDATE
There's a change that's come over America
A change that's great to see
We're going back to work again
It's better than it used to be
I'm feeling good about America
And I feel it everywhere I go
I'm feeling good about America
And I feel you ought to know

I'm feeling good about America
It's something great to see
I'm feeling good about CANDIDATE
And I'm feeling good about me
I'm feeling good about CANDIDATE
And I'm feeling good about me
Say, I'm just wild about CANDIDATE
And CANDIDATE's wild about me
The fates decreed it
And we concede it
CANDIDATE made history

FDR had his New Deal
And CANDIDATE will follow through
The country's wild about CANDIDATE
And CANDIDATE's wild about
Can not do without
The country and you!
Lindbergh flew the ocean
He flew all the way to France
Most of the way he flew
He flew by the seat of his pants
Good old American know-how
That's the way it ought to be
And if he's good enough for Lindy,
He's good enough for me!

If he's good enough for Lindy, he's good enough for me
If he's good enough for Lindy, he's good enough for me
If he's good enough for Lindy, he's good enough for me
CANDIDATE is the only man can keep our country free.

We all remember CANDIDATE
How he helped us in the war.
He helped us beat the Kaiser,
Now he'll give us four years more
He'll serve as our President
To keep our country free
And if he's good enough for Lindy
He's good enough for me!

If he's good enough for Lindy, he's good enough for me
If he's good enough for Lindy, he's good enough for me
If he's good enough for Lindy, he's good enough for me
CANDIDATE is the only man can keep our country free.
If the OPPONENT PARTY get into power again
Aha! Aha!
If the OPPONENT PARTY get into power again
Aha! Aha!
Our laws they'll jeer
Our flags they'll flout
They'll try to turn our officers out
And we'll all wear grey
If the OPPONENT PARTY get into power

Jeff Davis's name they'll proudly praise
Aha! Aha!
And Lincoln's tomb will be disgraced
Aha! Aha!
The nation's flag will lose its stars
The stripes they'll change to rebel bars
And we'll all wear grey
If the OPPONENT PARTY get into power

Bet that day of jubilee
Hurrah! Hurrah!
The OPPONENT PARTY's day we'll never see
Ha-ha! Ha-ha!
We have the pluck
The Yankee wit
We'll make the grey-backed rebels git
And we'll all be fools
If the Johnnies get into power

Then cheer for CANDIDATE three times three
Hurrah! Hurrah!
For CANDIDATE and for victory
Hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll put them in
There is no doubt
We'll keep the grey-backed OPPONENT PARTY out
And there'll be no day
When the OPPONENT PARTY get into power
And there'll be no day
When the OPPONENT PARTY get into power
Ye gentlemen and ladies fair, that grace New Orleans city,
Come listen, if you've time to spare, while I rehearse a ditty;
And for the opportunity consider yourself lucky:
It is not often that you see a hunter from Kentucky.

Oh, Kentucky! the hunters of Kentucky.

Now y'all been readin' in the public prints, how OPPONENT attempted
To make our CANDIDATE wince, but soon his scheme repented;
For CANDIDATE he was wide awake, he was not scared of trifles,
For well he knew what aim we take with our Kentucky rifles;

Oh, Kentucky! the hunters of Kentucky.

He led us down to the cypress swamp; the ground was low and mucky.
There came John Bull in martial pomp, and here stood old Kentucky.
CANDIDATE led our little band, none wished it to be greater,
For every man was half a horse and half an alligator.

Oh, Kentucky! the hunters of Kentucky.

Well, the British found 'twas vain to fight, where lead was all their booty,
And so they wisely took to flight, and left us all this beauty,
And so if danger e'er annoys, remember what our trade is,
Just send for us Kentucky boys, and we'll protect you ladies.

Oh, Kentucky! the hunters of Kentucky.
Oh, Kentucky! the hunters of Kentucky.
Ev'ry day brings something new
The locofocoes find it true
Strange events have proved to Martin
Doubtful things are most unsartin

Hark, the people rising say
He's the man to cope with OPPONENT
Ha ha, such a nominee
CANDIDATE of Tennessee!

His choice occasioned some surprise
Good PARTY rolled up their eyes
Oh, asking, "Tell us, who is he,
James K. Polk of Tennessee?"

Hark, the people rising say
He's the man to cope with OPPONENT
Ha ha, such a nominee
CANDIDATE of Tennessee!

But soon their vast excitement o'er
They see what ne'er was seen before
The best selection that could be
CANDIDATE of Tennessee!

Hark, the people rising say
He's the man to cope with OPPONENT
Ha ha, such a nominee
CANDIDATE of Tennessee!

Fall down before a better man
Than even little Matty Van
Buchanan, too, must bow his knee
To James K. Polk of Tennessee!

Hark, the people rising say
He's the man to cope with Clay
Ha ha, such a nominee
Jimmy Polk of Tennessee!
Just before election, CANDIDATE
We are thinking most of you;
While we get our ballots handy
Just be sure they're not for you;
No, dear CANDIDATE, you'll not get them,
But you will get what you deserve;
Yes, you'll get your leave of absence
As you swing around the curve.

You have swung around the circle
That you ought to swing, ‘tis true;
Oh, you tried to veto Congress,
But I guess they'll veto you.
In a quaint New England farmhouse on an early summer's day,
A farmer's boy became our Chief in a homely simple way,
With neither pomp nor pageantry, he firmly met the task,
To keep him on that job of his, is all the people ask. 

So "SLOGAN" is the slogan of the day,
"SLOGAN" for the good old U.S.A.
A lot of politicians cannot do a thing but knock,
But CANDIDATE is a man of action and not talk. 

So just "SLOGAN" in the White House four years more,
We have a chance to do it in this year of twenty-four,
He's been tried, he's never wanting,
He is giving of his best,
So "SLOGAN" in our country's mighty test.

With a private life of virtue
And a public record clean
He stands upon the summit
With a countenance serene
Defender of the righteous
And a juggernaut two rung
We'll make him stay in Washington
A hundred million strong

So "SLOGAN" is the slogan of the day,

Hurrah for the choice of our nation!
Our hero so brave and so true;
We'll go for the great reformation—
For CANDIDATE and Liberty, too!

We'll go for the boy from Kentucky
The hero of Hoosierdom through;
The pride of the Suckers so lucky
For CANDIDATE and Liberty, too.

Our David's good sling is unerring,
The Slavocrat giant he slew,
So shout if you're freedom preferring,
For CANDIDATE and Liberty, too.

We'll go for the son of Kentucky
The hero of Hoosierdom through;
The pride of the Suckers so lucky
For CANDIDATE and Liberty, too.

A rail-splittin' statesman can do;
The people are everywhere calling

The star-spangled red, white, and blue,
We'll fight till our cause is victorious,
For CANDIDATE and Liberty, too.

Its bolts could not rend Freedom's temple asunder; 
For, unmoved, at the portal, would George Washington stand,

When he comes home, hard cider he'll swig.
When he has swug, he'll fall in a stew;
And down will come OPPONENT.

Rock-a-bye, baby, when you awake,
You will discover OPPONENT is a fake.
Far from the battle, war cry, and drum,
He sits in his cabin a-drinking bad rum.

Rock-a-bye, baby, never you cry;
You need not fear ol' OPPONENT.
What they would ruin, CANDIDATE will fix:
CANDIDATE's a magician; they are but tricks.
Hear the call throughout the land
Come and proudly take your stand
Now uphold your chieftain's hand
CANDIDATE  the cry!

Blow the bugle, beat the drum
From the north and south they come
From the east and west they come
OPPONENT the cry!

Lincoln's name, McKinley's too,
They traduced and would anew
Trust them? I will not—will you?
OPPONENT the cry!

Let the OPPONENT PARTY named OPPONENT
All his evil venom spill
Yet he'll taste a bitter pill
OPPONENT the cry!

History shall write his name
On the immortal scroll of fame
They shall all his deeds proclaim
OPPONENT the cry!

OPPONENT, the soldier true
OPPONENT, the statesman too
Sane for me and safe for you
OPPONENT the cry!
Rum-a-dum-dum, vote for CANDIDATE!
Rum-a-dum-dum, son of freedom!
Rum-a-dum-dum, vote for CANDIDATE
He's the boy can skin and beat 'em!

Throughout land there's such a cry,
And we all know the reason why.
CANDIDATE's bars and stars
Beat Mexico's two-legged bars.

Rum-a-dum-dum, vote for CANDIDATE
Rum-a-dum-dum, son of freedom!
Rum-a-dum-dum, vote for CANDIDATE
He's the boy can skin and beat 'em!

He met 'em on the Rio Grande;
He played them "Yankee Doodle Dandy".
When brave CANDIDATE crossed the line,
He made them snort like a steam engine.

It's...
Rum-a-dum-dum, vote for CANDIDATE
Rum-a-dum-dum, son of freedom!
Rum-a-dum-dum, vote for CANDIDATE
He's the boy can skin and beat 'em!

CANDIDATE kicked up gun powderation
With the Texas annexation.
Anyone makes much ado,
He'll flog 'em and annex 'em too!

Everybody!
Rum-a-dum-dum, vote for CANDIDATE
Rum-a-dum-dum, son of freedom!
Rum-a-dum-dum, vote for CANDIDATE
He's the boy can skin and beat 'em!
Come swell the throng and join the song
Extend the circle wider!
Join the run for CANDIDATE, PARTY, and Hard Cider.

With CANDIDATE, our country's won
No treachery can divide her
Thy will be done with CANDIDATE, PARTY, and Hard Cider.

Let OPPONENT jeer and OPPONENT sneer
Like every such backslider!
The fight was won by CANDIDATE, PARTY, and Hard Cider.

To all the world our flag's unfurled
To vict'ry CANDIDATE guide her.
Second to none is CANDIDATE, PARTY, and Hard Cider!
There's right and wrong in parties,
And the right is on our side;
So mount the CANDIDATE wagon,
And through the nation ride!

The Union is our wagon,
The people are its springs;
And every true American,
For CANDIDATE sings!

Wait for the wagon,
The CANDIDATE wagon;
Wait for the wagon,
And we'll all take a ride!

Our wagon is a noble one,
'Twas made in seventy-six;
'Twas driven by George Washington,
Through stormy politics!

Palmetto, cypress, cottonwood,
In spokes and wheels you'll find;
Western oak and Eastern pine,
and Northern ash combined!

Wait for the wagon,
The CANDIDATE wagon;
Wait for the wagon,
And we'll all take a ride!

In this, our glorious wagon,
With VP CANDIDATE beside,
Through all the troubled elements
Brave CANDIDATE soon will ride!

And where the foreigner would rule
And freedom they would take
They will not play us for the fool
For we are wide awake!

Yes! wait for the wagon,
The CANDIDATE wagon;
Wait for the wagon,
And we'll all take a ride!
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me

As I was walking a ribbon of highway
I saw above me an endless skyway
I saw below me a golden valley
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me

I've roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me
Oh, who has heard the great commotion,
Motion, motion, all the country through?
It is the ball a-rolling on,
For CANDIDATE too,
For CANDIDATE too
And with them we'll beat little OPPONENT, OPPONENT,
OPPONENT is a used up man,
And with them we'll beat little OPPONENT.

Sure, let them talk about hard cider, cider, cider
And log cabins too,
'Twill only help to speed the ball
For CANDIDATE too,
For CANDIDATE too
And with them we'll beat little OPPONENT, OPPONENT,
OPPONENT is a used up man,
And with them we'll beat little OPPONENT.

Like the rush of mighty waters, waters, waters
Onward it will go
And its course will bring you through
For CANDIDATE too,
For CANDIDATE too
And with them we'll beat little OPPONENT, OPPONENT,
OPPONENT is a used up man,
And with them we'll beat little OPPONENT.
I heard a young man speaking out just the other day;
I stopped just to listen to what he had to say;
He spoke straight and simple—by that I was impressed.
He said, "Once and for all, why not the best?"

He said his name was CANDIDATE and he was running for President,
And he laid out a plan of action—made a lot of sense!
He talked about the government and how it used to be, for you and me;
That's the way it ought to be, right now:
Once and for all, why not the best?

He spoke plain and simple and I began to understand
I was listening to quite a man, talking to me.
I began to see...
We need CANDIDATE! Why settle for less?
America—
Once and for all, why not the best?

We need CANDIDATE! We can't afford to settle for less,
America—
Once and for all, why not the best?
Why not the best?
Why not the best?
Now convention days are over
And election time is near
From East and West, from North to South
There's just one name in ev'ry mouth

When a fellow meets a fellow
And he says to him, "What's yours?"
He says, "I think I'll have to drink
To the PARTY cause"

It's "CANDIDATE, that's all, CANDIDATE, that's all!"
Who strikes the public sentiment
Say who will be our President?
It's CANDIDATE, that's all

You'll hear them call, "Tammany, Tammany"
While on the street or on the car
While at your home ot at the bar
It's "CANDIDATE, CANDIDATE, CANDIDATE, that's all!"

OPPONENT had his steamroller
OPPONENT's hat was in the ring
OPPONENT came to town with his darned old hound
CANDIDATE kicked it all around

OPPONENT, he made speeches,
Not a delegate would fall
Till someone sang, "How dry I am!"
and the crowd began to call

It's "CANDIDATE, that's all, CANDIDATE, that's all!"
Who strikes the public sentiment
Say who will be our President?
It's CANDIDATE, that's all

You'll hear them call, "Tammany, Tammany"
While on the street or on the car
While at your home ot at the bar
It's "CANDIDATE, CANDIDATE, CANDIDATE, that's all!"
Well, I won't back down
No I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down

No I'll stand my ground
Won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down
Gonna stand my ground

And I won't back down
(I won't back down)
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
(I won't back down)
Hey I will stand my ground
And I won't back down
Well I know what's right
I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
But I'll stand my ground
And I won't back down
(I won't back down)
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
(I won't back down)
Hey I will stand my ground
(I won't back down)
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
(I won't back down)
Hey I won't back down
(I won't back down)
Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out
(I won't back down)
I will stand my ground
And I won't back down
No I won't back downIt was a creed written into the founding documents that declared the destiny of a nation.
Yes we can.
It was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as they blazed a trail toward freedom.
Yes we can. Yes we can.
It was sung by immigrants as they struck out from distant shores
And pioneers who pushed westward against an unforgiving wilderness.
Yes we can. Yes we can.
It was the call of workers who organized;
Women who reached for the ballots;
A President who chose the moon as our new frontier;
And a King who took us to the mountain-top and pointed the way to the Promised Land.
Yes we can to justice and equality.
(yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can...)

Yes we can to opportunity and prosperity.
Yes we can to opportunity and prosperity.
Yes we can heal this nation.
Yes we can repair this world.
Yes we can. Si Se Puede
(yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can...)

We know the battle ahead will be long,
But always remember that no matter what obstacles stand in our way,
Nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change.
We want change!
(We want change! We want change! We want change...)

We have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynics who will only grow louder and more dissonant.
We've been asked to pause for a reality check.
We've been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope.
But in the unlikely story that is America, there has never been anything false about hope. We want change!
(We want change! I want change! We want change! I want change...)

The hopes of the little girl who goes to a crumbling school in Dillon are the same as the dreams of the boy who learns on the streets of LA;
We will remember that there is something happening in America;
That we are not as divided as our politics suggests;
That we are one people;
We are one nation;
And together, we will begin the next great chapter in America's story with three words that will ring from coast to coast;
From sea to shining sea - Yes. We. Can.
(yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can...)
